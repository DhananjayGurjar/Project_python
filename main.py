# input      1  2   3
# rock    1  D  W   L
# scissor 2  L  D   W
# paper   3  W  L   D
this is a practice game 
the logic was not good but logic was not wrong 
# the cleaner way for this is to make logic instead of the using numbers just like b==r i.e. draw then the three case in which i win keep them in or and use else to get other outputs

#  give your output to ai and then see what are the mistake if it could be the professional generate the code by youself first
